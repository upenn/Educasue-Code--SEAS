# Educause Poster Presentation 2023

Co-presenting this with Alex Savoth and Drew Hopkins at the Educause conference in 2023. 

Gradescope is integrated within Canvas but won't pass the submission time to Canvas. 

For instructors who would like to use Canvas Late Policy for Gradescope submissions, this project has demoed an automated way to script the late submission time from the Gradescope course, then upload the late submission time to the Canvas on behalf of the student.
